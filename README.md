FACE RECOGNIZER - ML30 Hackathon

This project aims to identify members in Chanhchamchi-group1 utilizing OpenCV, Yolov3, and VGGFace.


Dataset

This homemade dataset includes 535 webcam-taken face images cropped with yolov3 of 4 members (2 males, 2 females).


Techical information

As preveiously mentioned, the OpenCV, Yolov3, and VGGFace have been used. While OpenCV involves in all webcam-related and image-processing tasks, Yolov3 mainly participate as a face detector. VGGFace is a model developed for face recognition and demonstrated on benchmark computer vision datasets. This model architecture and weights has been applied for our model.


Build status

Completed; Incoming upgrade: To improve accuracy and introduce new features.
